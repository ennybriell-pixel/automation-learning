# automation-learning

Documenting my journey learning workflow automation with n8n.

This repository is a learning log where I break things down step by step, starting from the basics and gradually building more complex workflows.

## What I’m focusing on
- Building simple automations before adding complexity

## Progress

### Initial experiments
- Tested basic email actions to understand how triggers and executions work

### Forms
- Built a simple form to capture user input
- Explored how form data appears inside a workflow
- Learned the difference between test mode and production submissions

### Next
- Experimenting with multi-step forms
- Connecting form inputs to automated actions

I’ll keep updating this as I build and learn.
